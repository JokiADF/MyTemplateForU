## Introduction
This template was inspired by [KSyndicateZenjectTemplate](https://github.com/DizzyJump/KSyndicateZenjectTemplate) and [Unity empty project template (UEPT)](https://github.com/vangogih/unity-empty-project-template) and is an amalgamation of those templates and my solutions to various situations in the project.

The project structure was taken from the [Unity empty project template (UEPT)](https://github.com/vangogih/unity-empty-project-template).
The rest of the project was based on personal experience and [KSyndicateZenjectTemplate](https://github.com/DizzyJump/KSyndicateZenjectTemplate).

## Dependencies
1. Addressables
2. [Zenject (Extenject)](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject)
3. [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask)
